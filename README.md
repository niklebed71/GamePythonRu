My first Python game with comment in russia.

Rules of the game.
Goal: score the maximum number of points by moving the robot
with the arrows left - right, collecting coins. 
When a robot collides with a triangle,the player receives a penalty of 10 points. 
When a robot collides with a coin, the player receives 5 points. 
When a robot collides with a monster, the game over.
